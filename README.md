# React + Vite

Steps to run project : 

First, clone my repository. Then, install the Node packages and run the command `npm run dev` to launch the project. 

To add a header, use the following syntax:
- `#` for h1
- `##` for h2
- `###` for h3

For text styling, use:
- `*` for bold
- `**` for red text
- `***` for underline

To remove the previous style, type `!`. 

Note: To add a style after each character, insert a space to apply the desired style.
